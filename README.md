# Swift Compiler Error: Missing Argument Labels

This repository demonstrates a common Swift compiler error that arises when calling functions without specifying the required parameter labels.  The error can be subtle and easily missed, particularly when working with functions having multiple parameters.

## The Problem

In Swift, functions often have parameter labels that improve code readability and help prevent accidental misuse.  When calling a function, these labels must be explicitly provided unless the function has been designed without them.

## How to Reproduce

Clone this repository, and look at the `bug.swift` file.  Observe the error generated by the compiler when the `calculateArea` function is called without the `width` parameter label.
